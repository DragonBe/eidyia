# Eidyia

According to [Wikipedia](), Eidyia was one of the Greek goddesses of knowledge. This project is all about knowledge.

Imagine there's a ton of information out there on the internet, all information about you that just lies there for grabs. Every security specialist knows how to access this information and can use this for good or bad against you.

So how about creating a tool that allows you to check yourself how much the internet knows about you and what you can do to defend yourself against (ab)use of this information without your permission.

This whole project started off by [a talk given by Keith Casey at TrueNorthPHP](https://joind.in/9992).
